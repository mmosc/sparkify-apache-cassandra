# Project Overview

Apache Cassandra project in the Data Engineering Udacity Nanodegree.  

## Introduction

At Sparkify, our app allows the user to stream music. We want to analyze the data on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. In particular, we want to understand what songs users are listening to. This repository allows to create an Apache Cassandra database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analyses.

## Dataset
Data reside in a the directory ```event_data```. It contains CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset
```
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
```

## Files 
In addition to the data files, there are  the following files:
1. ```Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb```, a jupyter notebook creating the tables and testing them with queries. It is described later in more detail
2. ```event_datafile_new.csv``` the .CSV file created by the ```Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb``` and collecting the data from the ```event_data``` folder
3. ```README.md``` this readme
4. ```images``` folder, contaning the images for the readme and for the jupyter notebook.


## Queries
The database is optimised for queries of the following type:
1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'

## ETL Pipeline and DB
The file ```Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb``` includes
1. the preprocessing of the files 
2. the creation of the DB
3. queries for testing the DB
### Preprocessing
The ETL pipeline for preprocessing the files iterates over the file in the ```event_data``` folder and writes them into a .CSV table. Each row in the table contains the following information
* artist
* firstName of user
* gender of user
* item number in session
* last name of user
* length of the song
* level (paid or free song)
* location of the user
* sessionId
* song title
* userId
The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data look like in the event_datafile_new.csv after preprocessing.

### Song Dataset
Sparkify song dataset (which truely is a subset of the real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)) consists of files in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```python
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```python
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log Dataset
The user activity dataset consists of log files from our music streaming app in JSON format generated by the Sparkify app (Truely: [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)) based on the songs in the dataset above. 

These log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```python
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Database Schema
The Database schema contains the following tables
#### Fact Table 
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```
* *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
#### Dimenson Tables
2. **users** - users in the app 
* *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. **songs** - songs in music database
* *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
* *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
* *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
It is organised as a start schema, that simplifies queries about user activities. The Entity Relation Diagram is as follows

The diagram is generated using [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/diagrams/features/erd-tool/). Primary keys are in bold font. I did not manage to do-undo italics to distinguish numerical entries...

## ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline that transfers data from tge set of CSV files within the directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model. Then it inserts data into Apache Cassandra tables. 

<!-- 
The ETL Pipeline is executed by running the ```etl.py``` file. It transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL. This is done by executing two similar functions, ```process_log_file``` and ```process_song_file```. The PostgreSQL queries for creating and inserting data are written out in the ```sql_queries.py``` file.

### Process Song
This function is applied to each ```.json``` file representing an element of our song dataset.
1. Read the file as pandas dataframe
2. Extract song data and insert them into the user_table

### Process Log
This function is applied to each ```.json``` file representing the activity on the app.
1. Read the file as a pandas dataframe
2. Filter by NextSong
3. Convert timestamp column to datetime format 
4. Split datetime to hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
5. Extract user data and insert them into the user_table
6. Extract songplay records (by querying the song_table and artist_table) and insert them into the songplay_table


## Usage
### Fill in the DB
1. Run ```create_tables.py``` to create the ```sparkifydb```. This is the database to which the other files connect.
2. Run ```etl.py``` process the data and insert them into the database.
### Queries
Example queries for each of the tables can be found in the ```test.ipynb``` file. As additional example, here's a query for checking on which day of the week a specific song, displayed by title, was played
```
SELECT  s.title, t.weekday 
FROM songplay_table AS sp JOIN song_table AS s ON sp.song_id=s.song_id
                        JOIN time_table AS t ON sp.start_time=t.start_time
```
This should return 
| title         | weekday       |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Setanta matins|2              |
